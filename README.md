Federated Learning Codes for VSD4TEL workshop at ECTEL 2023

Accepted Paper at Value-sensitive Design Methods for Technology-enhanced Learning (VSD4TEL) Workshop @ ECTEL 2023.

With the progress of applied artificial intelligence (AI) in education, there is a growing need to address the ethical and privacy concerns associated with machine learning (ML) systems. 
These concerns often require compromise among project partners involved in designing and implementing these systems, impacting the experiences of teachers, students, and other stakeholders. 
Our work focuses on integrating value-sensitive design (VSD) principles into ML systems' technical design and performance, specifically within the educational context.
To achieve this, we propose utilizing distributed and federated learning (FL) frameworks as a practical decentralized approach to training ML models, addressing critical issues such as data privacy and data security. 
We can uphold privacy and ethical considerations by adopting these frameworks while benefiting from educational and machine-learning partners' collective knowledge and expertise.
We conclude by outlining potential avenues for future research, aiming to continuously improve and expand the capabilities of privacy-preserving ML in educational settings. 
By blending VSD principles with technical advancements, we foster responsible and ethical practices while promoting practical ML applications in education.
